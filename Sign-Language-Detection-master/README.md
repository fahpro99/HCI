##Sign-Language-Detection

Sign-Language-Detection is an innovative project that leverages the power of deep learning, specifically TensorFlow and Keras, to recognize and interpret sign language gestures. This project enables real-time communication between individuals who use sign language and those who may not be proficient in it, breaking down communication barriers and fostering inclusivity.

###Overview
Sign language is a crucial means of communication for millions of people around the world. However, it's not always easy for everyone to understand and interpret sign language gestures. This project aims to bridge that gap by using advanced machine learning techniques to automatically detect and interpret signs.

###Features
Deep Learning with TensorFlow: Our project employs TensorFlow and Keras to build and train deep neural networks for sign language recognition. This allows for accurate and real-time recognition of gestures.

Multi-Library Integration: We've integrated various Python libraries to facilitate the development process. This includes NumPy for numerical operations, OpenCV for computer vision tasks, and Matplotlib for visualization.

###Customizable Models: The project provides customizable neural network models, allowing users to fine-tune the system for their specific sign language dialect or variations.

###Real-Time Detection: With the help of computer vision techniques, this project is capable of real-time sign language gesture detection through a webcam or video input.
